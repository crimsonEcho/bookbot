# BookBot

BookBot is my first [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) project.

A Python-based text analysis tool that processes .txt files (it may process other files, too, I haven't tested) to compute total word count and generate a list of alphabetical characters, sorted by frequency.

Thanks for checking it out!
